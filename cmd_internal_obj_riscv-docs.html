The stack looks like:
-------------------
|                 |
|      PARAMs     |
|                 |
|                 |
-------------------
|    Parent RA    |   SP on function entry
-------------------
|                 |
|                 |
|       AUTOs     |
|                 |
|                 |
-------------------
|        RA       |   SP during function execution
-------------------

FixedFrameSize makes other packages aware of the space allocated for RA.
